ABOUT
#########
This project is based on Aframe.io (https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/), which is a tool for
making 3D scenes, games, demos, etc. in the browser.

AFrame is actually a wrapper around THREE.js, which does all the heavy lifting.

You don't need to understand or worry about the details of how THREEjs or Aframe work.

We've provided all the setup and models you need for the project. You can focus entirely on how to make
the solution.

Everything runs in the browser, no additional setup is needed.

Be sure to read the example code in detail.
